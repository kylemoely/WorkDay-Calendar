  ## Description    
  This is a webpage that hosts a daily calendar in which the user may track their events for the day.    
      
  ## Installation    
  This is a simple web application. Follow the link above to the webpage to open it.    
      
  ## Usage    
  Upon opening the webpage, the user is presented with time blocks for each hour between 9AM and 5PM. The blocks are color coded based on the current time of the day. Past hours are grayed out, the current hour is displayed in red, and future hours in green. The user may log events into the individual time blocks and press the save button next to that time block to save the event. This event is saved to local storage and will be reloaded when the user leaves and returns to the page. When the Clear Calendar button at the top of the page is pressed, the calendar and local storage are cleared of all events.
